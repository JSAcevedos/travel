Travel Exercise

Carlos, a systems engineering student, is planning to travel during his vacation after this semester ends in July. He reached out to his friend Mariana, a renowned tour guide in the region, for recommendations. Mariana suggests traveling to different towns in Boyac√°. Carlos likes the idea and asks Mariana to provide a list of places he should visit. Mariana writes the following list:

{"Mongui", "Sachica", "Tinjaca", "Combita", "Chiquiza", "Sutamarchan", "Tibasosa", "Toca", "Guican", "Chivata", "Topaga", "Soraca", "Gameza", "Guayata", "Raquira", "Nobsa", "Tenza", "Aquitania"}

However, Carlos, being passionate about applying what he learns in Data Structures to his daily life, decides to add the places from Mariana's list to an AVL tree one by one, maintaining lexicographic order.

After creating the AVL tree, Carlos wonders what the minimum number of places he needs to visit between two locations in the tree is, including both the starting and ending locations.

Input
Two different starting and ending locations, separated by a space.

Output
The output should be the minimum number of places Carlos needs to visit in the tree traversal, including both the starting and ending locations.

Examples

Input

Tinjaca Guican

Output

6

Input

Tenza Chivata

Output

7

Please note: The AVL tree structure and traversal logic are not explained in this problem statement.
